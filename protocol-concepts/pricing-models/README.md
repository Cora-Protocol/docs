# Pricing models

One of the killer features of the Cora protocol, is the ability to be able to change its pricing model in a decentralized manner. This will open the possibility for actors in the ecosystem to propose new pricing models that can benefit all the participants of the Cora Protocol and to earn performance rewards for their proposed models during its lifetime of operation in the protocol.

To understand more about the importance of a decentralized pricing model approach where we incentivise any participant to become a Cora contributor, we need to understand why Pricing models are important.

**Introduction**

The holy grail in the Option pricing world is to find the right amount of money an Option seller should charge (known as premium) in exchange for the risk of taking the selling side.

In general, the Option pricing theory aims to find the fair price of an Option based on the calculated probability that the Option will finish in the money (ITM) at expiration.

Some commonly models to value options are:

* Black-Scholes
* Heston
* Binomial

These models consider variables such as current asset spot price, strike price, volatility, interest rate, and time to expiration to theoretically value an option.&#x20;

**Decentralized Pricing Model**

Cora is Option Pricing agnostic and have the capability to modify the pricing model used to price Borrowing Fees.

Our long term goal is to enable multiple ecosystem participants to interact with the protocol to achieve this.
