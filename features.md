# Features

**Capital Efficient**

One of the main features of the Cora protocol is the capital efficiency, Liquidity providers simple deposit stablecoins in the Lending pools. We also plan to develop multi collateral Lending pools that will allow 1 single pool of stablecoins to be used to provide non-liquidatable loans for a variety of collaterals.

**Community owned**

The Cora protocol is fully community owned, our goal is to design native economic mechanisms that will incentivise multiple participants to support and benefit from the protocol's success.

**Decentralized Pricing models**&#x20;

The Cora Protocol will allow any external participant to propose new pricing models in the protocol. Accepted pricing models will be voted via governance and will be awarded with 1% of the total protocol fees for the lifetime of their pricing model.

We expect quantitative finance analysts, financial engineers and any other participant to propose different pricing models that can help the overall health of the system and benefit Borrowers, Liquidity Providers and the Cora Protocol.&#x20;

**Modular Pricing models**

Lending pools can have associated any of the whitelisted price models. This modularity feature will allow the creation of new types of products on top of Cora. We predict that once the DAO enables permissionless pool creation, this will allow anybody to create their own Lending pools with custom price models.

**Immutable**

The Cora protocol smart contracts are **NON** upgradeable, this means the protocol rules are fully written in code.&#x20;

**Permissionless**&#x20;

In the first version of the Cora protocol the Cora DAO is the only entity that can create Lending pools. However, we expect the community to remove this restriction and allow to any party the creation of Liquidity pools in a permissionless fashion.
