# Getting Started
## Welcome to the Cora Protocol docs. This documentation aims to provide a high-level overview of the protocol and its existing components.

### What is Cora?

Cora is a decentralized lending platform that allow borrowers to get interest free, non-liquidatable loans using ETH or any supported ERC-20 token as collateral with optimised collateral ratio, helping borrowers to get the most of their assets without the risk of being liquidated.
Borrowers can get any of the supported Stablecoins in the system for a fixed period of time. The initial release will only support loans of 30, 60 and 90 days, however future versions of the protocol will allow users to get a loan for any period of time.
Lenders or Liquidity Providers can provide Stablecoins as liquidity to the protocol and earn Borrowing Fees for doing so.
