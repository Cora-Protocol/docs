# Getting Started

### **What is Cora?**

[Cora](https://www.cora.money) is a decentralized lending platform that allow borrowers to get **interest free**, **non-liquidatable** loans using ETH or any supported ERC-20 token as collateral with optimised collateral ratio, helping borrowers to get the most of their assets without the risk of being liquidated.

Borrowers can get any of the supported **Stablecoins** in the system for a fixed period of time. The initial release will only support loans of 30, 60 and 90 days, however future versions of the protocol will allow users to get a loan for any period of time.

Lenders or Liquidity Providers can provide **Stablecoins** as liquidity to the protocol and earn **Borrowing Fees** for doing so.&#x20;

### **Why Cora?**

One of the biggest pain points in the decentralized lending world are the liquidations. Users can lose their collateral due to price decreases and extreme market volatility conditions.&#x20;

In addition to that, collateral ratios tend to be high in traditional lending protocols and capital inefficient.&#x20;

Cora solves both problems by introducing a new Defi Primitive:

{% hint style="info" %}
Lending + Options Strategies = **Cora**
{% endhint %}

This combination allow **Borrowers** to get non liquidatable loans with optimised collateral ratios at a competitive [Borrowing Fee](protocol-concepts/borrowing-fees.md) and Liquidity Providers to lend stablecoins with a [Risk Management](protocol-concepts/risk-management.md) framework that helps them to avoid loses and accumulate yield automatically.
