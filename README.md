# Getting Started

### **What is Cora?**

[Cora](https://www.cora.money) is a decentralized lending platform that allow borrowers to get **interest free and non-liquidatable** loans.

Using ETH or any supported ERC20 token as collateral, borrowers can borrow stablecoins for a fixed period of time and only pay a one-time borrowing fee without the risk of being liquidated.

Lenders or Liquidity Providers can provide **stablecoins** as liquidity to the protocol and earn [Borrowing Fees](protocol-concepts/borrowing-fees.md) for doing so.

### **Why Cora?**

One of the biggest pain points in the decentralized lending world are the liquidations. Borrowers can lose their collateral due to price decreases and extreme market volatility conditions.

In addition to that, collateral ratios tend to be high in traditional lending protocols and capital inefficient.

Cora solves both problems by introducing a new Defi Primitive:

{% hint style="info" %}
Lending + Options Strategies = **Cora**
{% endhint %}

This combination allow borrowers to get non liquidatable loans with optimised collateral ratios at a competitive [Borrowing Fee](protocol-concepts/borrowing-fees.md) and Liquidity Providers to lend stablecoins with a [Risk Management](protocol-concepts/risk-management.md) framework that helps them to avoid loses and maximise yield automatically.

To learn more about how Cora works, see the [How Cora works](protocol-concepts/how-cora-works.md) section.
