# Getting Started

### **What is Cora?**

[Cora](https://www.cora.money) is a decentralized lending platform that allow users to borrow stablecoins for a fixed period of time and only pay a one-time borrowing fee **without the risk of being liquidated**.

Borrowers can use any supported token as collateral, including ERC-20s and ERC-4626s.

Liquidity Providers can provide any supported **stablecoin** as liquidity to the protocol and earn [Borrowing Fees](protocol-concepts/borrowing-fees.md) for doing so.

We have created a video explainer to help you learn more about Cora.

### **Why Cora?**

One of the biggest pain points in the decentralized lending world are the **liquidations**. Borrowers can lose their collateral due to price decreases and extreme market volatility conditions.&#x20;

In addition to that, collateral ratios in traditional lending protocols tend to be high and capital inefficient.

Cora solves both problems by introducing a new Defi Primitive:

{% hint style="info" %}
Lending + Options Strategies = **Cora**
{% endhint %}

This combination allow borrowers to get non liquidatable loans with optimised collateral ratios at a competitive [Borrowing Fee](protocol-concepts/borrowing-fees.md) and Liquidity Providers to provide stablecoins with a [Risk Management](protocol-concepts/risk-management.md) framework that helps them to avoid loses and earn yield automatically.

To learn more about how Cora works, see the [How Cora works](protocol-concepts/how-cora-works.md) section.
