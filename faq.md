# FAQ

**What if I forget to pay back my loan?**

If a user doesn't pay back his loan before the expiration date, the user automatically will lose the collateral locked. Note that this might change in future versions of the protocol where we could allow users to recover their collateral in exchange of a recovery fee.

**What if my collateral significantly drop in price?**

If a user's collateral drops in price below the amount he borrowed, the user will end up profiting from the loan, since now he can simply not repay the loan and buy the collateral in a secondary market and keep the remaining stablecoin as profit.

For example.

Let's say the ETH price at borrowing time was 1000 USDC, and the user takes a loan of 800 USDC minus 35 USDC of borrowing fee, he got effectively:

> 800 **** USDC **** - 35 USDC = 765 USDC&#x20;

Now, at expiration time the ETH price is 700 USDC.

Since the user has got 765 USDC, there is no point to return to the platform to recover an asset that is worth less that the original amount he borrowed. So the user can buy the asset in a secondary market for 700 USDC and keep the extra 65 USDC as profit.

**Can I get a loan at anytime of the day?**

The Cora Protocol is a set of Smart Contracts that run on top of a Blockchain. This means that the Cora Protocol is censorship resistant and fully decentralized.&#x20;

Any person at any time can get a loan in the Cora Protocol without any geographical restriction.

**Why do the loans expire?**

The Cora Protocol core functionality is based on European style Put Options, and since European style options have an expiration date, the Cora Protocol inherits this behaviour.&#x20;

**What if I want to repay my loan before expiry and want my collateral back?**

You can repay your loan at any point before the expiration date and you will get your collateral back.

**How safe are my funds?**

As any Decentralized Finance project, the Cora Protocol has inherent risks for the simply fact of being in a decentralized setting.&#x20;

However, we take security very serious and we understand how important are the funds the Cora protocol handle. For that reason, we have audited the contracts with some of the top security firms in the space (see [audits](security/audits.md) section for more details). In addition to that, we follow the most recommended smart contracts practices and finally we have defined procedures so we can be ready for unexpected situations, these procedures include upgradeability of the protocol and emergency stops mechanisms.
