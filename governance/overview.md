description: Learn about our road to decentralization and the DAO structure.

# Overview

Our vision is to have a fully Decentralised Autonomous Organisation to fully govern and decide the course of the Cora Protocol. The DAO will be responsible for managing the treasury and upgrades of the protocol.

The transition to fully decentralization is planned in different stages.

#### Initial DAO Structure <a href="#9a14" id="9a14"></a>

The Cora DAO has two roles: the council and the community board. The council will be form by 4 core members of the protocol and the community board is made up of 20 highly-engaged community members.

The council can create proposals and vote on them. If the majority of the council confirms or rejects a proposal, that decision will stand. Initially, only the council can make proposals. This will be changed once the DAO is operating efficiently.
