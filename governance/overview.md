description: Learn about our road to decentralization and the DAO structure.

# Overview

Our vision is to have a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation to fully govern and decide the course of the Cora Protocol. The DAO will be responsible for managing the treasury and upgrades of Cora.

The DAO bootstrapping and creation will be a process where Cora developers will work together with the community in order to align goals and incentives.

We invite all people interested to visit our [Discord](https://discord.gg/f2CBcXe3cv) to keep up to date with the latest progress of the Cora DAO.
