# Tokenomics

The Cora Protocol goal is to be fully community governed and we plan to have 2 main tokens:

* Cora
* xCora

**The Cora token** is a profit sharing token that can be staked and will allow stakers to earn protocol fees and boost their rewards if they are adding liquidity or borrowing in the protocol.

**xCora** is the token stakers will receive for staking their Cora tokens. It will represent the right to vote on any major changes of the protocol and the spending of the treasury. &#x20;

More details about the tokenomics will be released soon.
