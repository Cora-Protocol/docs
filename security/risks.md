# Risks

#### **Risks**

As in any other system where users provide liquidity, there are risks inherent of the nature of a decentralized system, like hacks or black swan events that could make the markets crash.

However, we have worked in trying to minimise them, by auditing our code (see [Audits](audits.md) section), defining procedures for contingency and unexpected situations and by having a Risk Management framework that has been backtested and simulated (see the [Risk Management ](../protocol-concepts/risk-management.md)section for more details).&#x20;
