# Risk Managers

The Cora protocol has native incentive mechanisms that rewards users who contribute to the overall risk management of the protocol.

Risk managers are users with experience and expertise in quantitative financial methods to manage the overall risk of financial systems.

Risk managers can contribute in the following ways:

* Proposing new price models that can be used by other users and be integrated into a particular Lending pool
* Proposing changes in the Lending pool parameters that have the goal of improving the performance of the strategy
* Disputing changes proposed by others
* Updating parameters in the price models
