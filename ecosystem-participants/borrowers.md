# Borrowers

In traditional lending protocols, borrowers take the full risk, since they are exposed to liquidations and price decreases.&#x20;

In addition to that, borrowers have to monitor their positions constantly and top up their positions in case their collateral ratio goes down.

In Cora protocol, borrowers are safe, there is not risk of being liquidated and they keep the full upside of their collateral.

We can view the borrowers position in the following way:

As we can see, borrowers have a limited downside, which is specified by the amount the borrow, which means they are fully protected, however we can see that they still have the unlimited upside.
