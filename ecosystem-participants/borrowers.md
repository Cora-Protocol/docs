# Borrowers

In traditional lending protocols, borrowers take the full risk, since they are exposed to liquidations and price decreases.&#x20;

In addition to that, they have to monitor their positions constantly and manage their loans.

In Cora borrowers are safe, there is not risk of being liquidated and they keep the full upside of their collateral.

We can view the borrowers position in the following way:

As we notice, borrowers have a limited downside specified by the amount the borrow, which means they are fully protected, however we can see that they still have the unlimited upside.
