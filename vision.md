  Learn how we envision Cora as a fundamental block of a whole new suite of Defi
  applications.

# ðŸŒˆ Vision

Cora is a new protocol type that can serve as a money lego and fundamental block for future applications that can take advantage of a non-liquidatable base layer.&#x20;

Some of the applications we envision can be built on top of Cora and we plan to develop some of them or support via grants are:

**Leverage Protected Vault**&#x20;

A product where users can deposit their ETH, then the vault will borrow and buy more ETH to increase farming or staking rewards without the risk of being liquidated.

**Staking Vault**&#x20;

A product where users can deposit their ETH, then the vault will stake the ETH for instance in Lido and use the stETH to get a loan and provide liquidity to the protocol, earning fees for staking and for being liquidity provider in the Cora protocol.

We invite the community to help us to find new use cases and build on top of Cora !
