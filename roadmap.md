### December 2021: Testnet launch

The Cora Protocol will release an initial version in the Rinkeby network. The goal of this testnet release is to start battle-testing the protocol in a close to production environment.

**The details of this release include:**

* Supported Collateral: **ETH**.
* Supported Stablecoins: **USDC**
* Supported Loan Durations: **30, 60, 90 days.**
* Option Pricer Model: **BlackScholes** using worst case scenario values.&#x20;
* Liquidity Cap: **No limits.**

### January 2022: Token Sale

The Cora Protocol will perform a fair token sale in an auction platform. We will auction 5% of the total token supply. See the [Tokenomics](governance/tokenomics.md) section for more details about the token distribution.

### March 2022: Audit

The Cora Protocol will be audited at the end of Q1 of 2022. We will perform audits with Consensys Diligence and OpenZeppelin.

### April 2022: Mainnet launch

The Cora Protocol will be released to Production in April 2022.

**The details of this release include:**

* Supported Collateral: ETH.
* Supported Stablecoins: USDC
* Supported Loan Durations: 30, 60, 90 days.

### May 2022: Increase Liquidity Cap

Increase Liquidity cap to 100 Millions.

### **June 2022: Any loan duration**

The Cora Protocol will allow users to get a loan for any duration using ETH as collateral.

We expect this to unlock a whole vast range of applications built of top of Cora.

### July 2022: Decentralized Pricing models&#x20;

The Cora Protocol will allow any external participant to propose new pricing models in the protocol. Accepted pricing models will be voted via governance and will be awarded with 1% of the total protocol fees for the lifetime of their pricing model.

We expect quantitative analysts, financial engineers and any other participant to propose different pricing models that can help the overall health of the system and benefit Borrowers, Liquidity Providers and the Cora Protocol.&#x20;

### August 2022: stETH as collateral

The Protocol will include stETH as a supported collateral. It means we will create a new Pool in the system.
