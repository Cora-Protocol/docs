# Roadmap

### June 2022: Testnet launch

The Cora Protocol will release an initial version in the Rinkeby network. The goal of this testnet release is to start battle-testing the protocol in a close to production environment.

**The details of this release include:**

* Supported Collateral: **WETH**.
* Supported Stablecoins: **USDC**
* Supported Loan Durations: **30 days.**
* Option Pricer Model: **BlackScholes.**
* Liquidity Cap: **No limits.**

### August 2022: DAO Formation&#x20;

The Cora Protocol will be a community owned protocol. Together with the community we will define the rules  and guidelines to allow any person to be part of the DAO.

### August 2022: Audit

The Cora Protocol will be audited at the end of Q3 of 2022. We will perform audits with Consensys Diligence and OpenZeppelin.\
