# ðŸ†• Cora V2

Cora v2 is an enhanced version of Cora. Same benefits, more possibilities and a more scalable and robust architecture. You can check our initial announcement [here](https://medium.com/coraprotocol/the-future-of-cora-introducing-cora-v2-4aa7f4d0c1f).

Let's deep dive into Cora v2 and why we believe is a game changer.

### V2 Features

#### Flexible loan durations

The version 2 of Cora maintains the same benefits as Cora v1. Users can borrow stablecoins for a fixed period of time and only pay a one-time borrowing fee **without the risk of being liquidated.**

However, the duration of the loans now is more flexible. In Cora v1 users were able to borrow up to a maximum of 30 days if they were able to borrow in the first day of the round.

In Cora v2 loans have flexible loan durations up to 1 year. Although the current testnet supports only a maximum of 90 days. The capability to borrow for 1 year is possible.

#### Simplified UI&#x20;

Cora V2 introduces a new borrowing experience with a UI style similar to Uniswap. Borrowers simply define the collateral they want to lock, the amount to borrow, the loan duration and you are set !

This new user experience is thanks to our new modular architecture that includes a router engine to help borrowers find the best rates across all the Lending pools in the Cora universe.
